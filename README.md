# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
This project is a personal initiative to design and build a modern Data Warehouse architecture using a layered approach (Bronze, Silver, Gold). It demonstrates core data engineering concepts such as schema design, data ingestion, normalization, and analytical querying.

# Project Overview

### Objective
The goal of this to project is:

1. Design a scalable Data Warehouse structure using the Medallion Archtecture the Bronze-Silver-Gold data modeling layers
2. Create ETL pipelines: extracting, Transform and Loading data from the Source system into the datawarehouse.
3. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## Structure
Bronze Layer: Raw ingested data (CRM, ERP, etc.)

Silver Layer: Cleaned and joined data using Stored procedures in SSMS

Gold Layer: Aggregated, business-ready data models

## Used Technologies

- SQL Server / T-SQL

- GitHub for version control
